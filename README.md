# Streamer Theme template
> This is a template for a streamer theme.

It consists of two main files, the background image and the config file.

## Background image
The background image has to have a size of 1920px x 1080px and has to be a jpg with a file extension of **jpg**. From the example you can see, that the "No signal" placeholders are placed on the background image directly.

## Config file
The config file has to provide the given options - since this is sourced from a bash script, you can use bash functionality as you see fit - for example to calculated positions.
